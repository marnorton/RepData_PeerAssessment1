## Loading and preprocessing the data

Read the CSV data from the raw file:
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Use the tapply function to get the total number of steps for each day: 
```{r}
StepsPerDay <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum)
```


Calculate the mean steps using the mean function, and setting na.rm = TRUE to exclude any "NA" values:
```{r}
MeanStepsPerDay <- mean(StepsPerDay, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(MeanStepsPerDay)

```

Calculate the median steps using the medain function, and setting na.rm = TRUE to exclude any "NA" values:
```{r}
MedianStepsPerDay <- median(StepsPerDay, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(MedianStepsPerDay)

```
